Although he occasionally plays as a center forward, Vega’s prominent position is as a winger. Not to mention that he currently sports the number 10 for his team.</span></p><p><span>In a similar vein, Vega has already made his senior team debut for Mexico, and in 2019 he also contributed to the team’s CONCACAF Gold Cup victory.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>The CONCACAF Olympic Qualifying Championship Golden Ball (2020) and CONCACAF Olympic Qualifying Championship Best XI are a couple of the accolades that Vega has received.</span></p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=alexis-vega-wife-who-is-paula-gonzalez></span><span>Alexis Vega Wife: Who Is Paula González?</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p><span>Regarding his romantic relationships, Vega is married to Paula Gonzalez, his former girlfriend. The couple had been dating for a while. However, they haven’t shared much information about how they first met. Following several years of dating, Vega proposed to his girlfriend in 2021.</span></p><p><span>The professional footballer, whose Instagram handle is @alexisvega.9, posted a video of their engagement there. They haven’t disclosed anything about their marriage either, in addition.</span></p><p><span>The couple has two children, a son and a daughter, and has welcomed them into the world. It seems like Vega’s partner is a prominent Instagram user and social media influencer.</span></p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=alexis-vega-family-what-is-their-ethnicity></span><span>Alexis Vega Family: What Is Their Ethnicity?</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p><span>On November 25, 1997, in Mexico City, Ernesto Alexis Vega Rojas was born to his parents. Ernesto Vega, the Father of Vega, comes from a wealthy family.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>His mother and other family members specifics are still a mystery at this time. Their ethnicity is Mexican.</span></p><p><span>Growing up in Mexico, it was famous for children participating in various sports.</span></p><p><span>Over time, it became apparent that Alexis was far superior to his peers in his ability to control the ball with his feet. As a result, the young boy occasionally focused on playing football out of passion.</span></p><p><span>He had no idea that, eventually, playing sports would enable him to support his family and himself financially. The enthusiasm his Father, Ernesto Vega, had for the game also contributed to his love of football.</span></p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=alexis-vega-net-worth-in-2022-how-rich-is-the-player></span><span>Alexis Vega Net Worth In 2022: How Rich Is The Player?</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p><span>According to popularbio.com, Alexis Vega’s net worth in 2022 is estimated to be between $1- $5 Million.</span></p><p><span>Vega has a contract worth €5.28 million with Chivas and has signed an agreement with them. So, the professional football player may receive a fair wage from the team.</span></p><p><span>According to the same report by Transfermrkt, Vega is currently worth €8.00m. Vega has additionally represented Guadalajara. While in Guadalajara, Vega earned a weekly salary of £5,500 and a yearly salary of £286,000.</span></p><p><span>Similarly to that, Vega has worked with some companies. He once worked with GQ Mexico. Therefore, we can assume that he may have made a respectable profit.</span></p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=alexis-vega-career-details-explored></span><span>Alexis Vega Career Details Explored</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p><span>Vega played his entire youth career for Toluca, and on February 27, 2016, he made his senior team debut while competing against Pachuca.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Additionally, on April 5, Vega notched his first goal as a professional. After playing 18 games and scoring 12 goals, Vega transferred to Guadalajara for a $9 million fee.</span></p><p><span>Similarly, Vega appeared in over 100 games for the Guadalajara squad and contributed 22 goals. Vega is reportedly playing for Chivas at this time.</span></p><p><span>The national footballer also participated in 14 professional games for the Mexico U23 team and scored four goals while playing there. </span><span>Vega also played against Paraguay on March 26, 2019, in his senior national team debut.</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaKWVrbakrc1mnainpJeurbiMsJ%2BoZZmoerGt1KWYZp%2Bfo8eiuMSzZJqkla22tHnVnp6aZaees6Z5xZqkoqSpYrK1tM2imqKsqWKur7CMp5ytZaekv7W0jg%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./a-mysterious-new-scream-vi-character-has-already-raised-suspicions-amongst-the-fandom.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="A mysterious new Scream VI character has already raised suspicions amongst the fandom">&larr;
